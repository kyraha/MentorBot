# Experimental Robot code
This is an experiment. Feel free to read and learn and maybe copy and paste some parts or clone the entire repository
for any purposes. The code is designed for an FRC (First Robotics Competition) robot running on RoboRIO compute unit within the
WPILib framework. Because of the experimental nature of the code some parts or the whole project may or may not work.
However I'm going to try to keep the main branch more or less functional.

## Installation
WPILib website has extremily detailed and well structured documentation on how to start programming your robot.
Please refer to https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/ - it's a treasure trove of knowledge for FRC robots control system.

## Contributons
I don't expect help on this project. However, if you want to participate of suggest improvements, or just have any ideas
please feel free to ping me. We can talk.
